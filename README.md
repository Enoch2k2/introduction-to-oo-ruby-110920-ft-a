## Introduction To OO Ruby

### What is a Ruby Object?

- object id
- class name
- methods
- attributes

### Why an object over a hash?

Hashes are not actionable. Hashes can not store methods.

### Where to code and how to run the program:

- You can use the `run` file in bin to code. Make sure to code above the `binding.pry` and below the `require_relative "../lib/environment"` line.
- You can run the code by typing in the terminal `ruby bin/run`.
